== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Nelio Content a free plugin? =

Yes. Nelio Content can be used completely for free using the version available at WordPress.org which provides essential features for content creation and social media management. However, to access advanced capabilities and unlock its full potential, you‚Äôll need to purchase a [premium plan](https://neliosoftware.com/content/pricing/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nelio-content).

With any [premium plan](https://neliosoftware.com/content/pricing/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nelio-content) you can connect up to 15 social profiles from any of the integrated social networks.

= What are Social Automations? =

Social Automations is Nelio Content‚Äôs powerful feature that revolutionizes social media promotion.

After you create a new post, Nelio Content automatically analyzes its content to extract the most relevant sentences.

Unlike basic Social Templates, these messages are crafted using the specific content of your post, maximizing engagement and reach.

= Are Social Automations included in the free version of Nelio Content? =

Yes but with some limitations. With the free version you have a unique set of social templates that can be used for automatic message generation. Only one message per connected social profile will be published at the same time as the post is.

= Can I change my plan later? =

Sure, you can do it whenever you want. And if you have some specific needs that none of our plans satisfy, just let us know and we‚Äôll be happy to help you!

= Can I cancel my subscription at any time? =

Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time. You can do it from the WordPress Dashboard or contacting us directly.
